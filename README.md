# ChatGpt_like_Chat

 In this project I made a chatgpt model with understanding of how humman end and start coversation and make it learn it using tokkenizer and embedding class of keras.
 I said it static because I have given the model both input and outut on which it trainn itself.

 This is just a inital phase model with a limitation as if too many intent input output added then model become difficult to update for future.
